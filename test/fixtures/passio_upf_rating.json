  "chainOfThought": "This granola contains several ingredients that contribute to it being ultra-processed. These include soluble corn fiber, rice flour, sugar, canola and/or sunflower oil, molasses, honey, barley malt extract, and natural flavor. These ingredients, especially the soluble corn fiber and canola/sunflower oil, increase the level of processing beyond minimally processed."
